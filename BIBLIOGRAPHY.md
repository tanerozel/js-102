Here are some other reference links, that might be handy by the way:

## Hey, I found something called http://www.w3schools.com/

I **strongly recommend** you **avoid it** at all costs. Even StackOverflow is a better resource than that, trust me! 

That is my personal (and honest) opinion; there are **much** better resources than w3schools. Your mileage may vary, of course.

> Consuming w3schools is like living on candies instead of a, proper, balanced diet.

’Nuf said.
