I have given references to related sites and further reading material inside the source code, thus I’m not maintaining a separate list here (•that might change if/when I decide to convert this repository into a book maybe*)

I love to give credits when it is due.

If I’ve forgotten to give citation or attribution to a particular resource, [just let shoot me an email](mailto:me@volkan.io) and I’ll fix it right away.

Here are some other reference links, that might be handy by the way:

## Hey, I found something called http://www.w3schools.com/

I **strongly recommend** you **avoid it** at all costs. Even StackOverflow is a better resource than that, trust me! 

That is my personal (and honest) opinion; there are **much** better resources than w3schools. Your mileage may vary, of course.

> Consuming w3schools is like living on candies instead of a, proper, balanced diet.

’Nuf said.
