# JS-102

This repository helps you learn JavaScript (the right way) so that you can confidently use higher-level libraries and frameworks. — Let’s reveal the magic!

## Why?

So you have “some” idea of the thing called “JavaScript”. You might even have gotten your hands dirty with libraries like Angular, React, Ember; however, you still feel a little “in the air”.

This repository aims to put your feet on a solid ground, so that when you start working on your next big UI-intensive project, you will feel confident.

It is hard to squeeze everything but the kitchen sink about the language without being pedantic. The goal of this repo is to keep the material interesting and practical, with a sane amount of explanation so the the interested reader can dig in the details if they want to.

This repo is in its early stages right now, and as always feedback, contributions, comments and suggestions are welcome.

## Requirements

A recent version of Node.JS runtime (v.7+ recommended).

We won’t be using any transpilers and we will be limiting the content to pure JavaScript.

## Installation

Although the majority of the examples in this repository are written in plain JavaScript, some examples include external dependencies to discuss certain programming patterns (*like, Reactive Functional Programming, for example*).

To install the dependencies, fork or clone this repository and just run…

```bash
npm install
```

…at the project root.

## Typical Usage

This repository is logically split into folders, where each folder is related to a specific topic.

First and foremost, make sure you **read the source, Luke**; there are useful tips, reference links, and further discussion in the source code. — So read the source code as if it was a book.
To run any example, just `cd` into its folder and run the scripts using node.

Here’s an example.

```text
$ cd 001_modules/
$ ls
index.js
$ node index.js

-.–.—.-.–.—.-.–.—.-.–.—

`true` is truthy.

-.–.—.-.–.—.-.–.—.-.–.—

$
```
